Buisness Problem : The Main Challenge the major hospital face is that if X-ray machine go down,they would have to compromise with their service and which lead to loss of revenue and patient for them,
        Our Main task,is to make sure that if an X-ray machine goes down,we're able to get it back up as quikely as possible.
        
Solution Starergey:
 1. Buisness problem indentification and solution
 2. formulate buiness problem to datat science problem
 3. understanding tool which understand data like pre-processing,cleaning,
 4. How to model data to predict issue such complex machine like x-ray
 5. how the modele is good by model evalution.
 
 
 Step 1: Buisness problem identification:
        - here a x-ray machine handler or doctor found issue with it like malfunction or it get heated or beeping sound etc.
        - so when a any x-ray machine failed then hospital called to manufacture or expert support to identify root cause of issue (Online expert support)
        - Then to identify root cause(Trobleshoot tools) it may take 4-8 days with 5000 doller loss/day.
        - when he found issue then he also required exchange part to replace so he order them ,so also required 3-5 days with 400 doller /visit.
        - Then to install it and fixed x-ray machine required 3-5 days required 400 doller/visit
        
        - So time taken to fix the machine :10-18 days.
        - Total revenue lost:50 doller to 100K.
        
 Step 2: convert business problem to data science problem.
        - Here which step do you think will be suitable for optimaizing using machine learning algorithm.
        -- We observed that the 3rd step,the online expert takes around 4-8 days to idnetify the root cause of the problem and recommend certain possible solution .
        -- Here ,the expert looksat the machine logs and the doctor description and along with their technical knowledge give the neccesary recommendation as to which parts might be faulty,
        -- And nned to be replaced .
        -- Machine learning solution would be most suitable for optimise this stepwhere a model can be build on past issue datat to give reccomendations automatically.
        
 Step 3:Identifying model.
        - ``As we know problem where a model would be handling out recommendation on the possibly faulty parts based on the machine data and the doctor's description and therfor help the online export in saving a tremendous amount of time.``
        - As per our data contain categorical data so we categorical approach classification model .
        - In our data contain all history for reason for faulty,how to be tackeld ,and which part may going faulty from all the part of x-ray machine .
        - so we check which part is mostly get faulty so we can comapre current situation.
        - Another soLn: Since you're trying to predict the class of the faulty product on the basis of the machine data and the doctor's description.It would be similar to identifying whether ,
                - a customer will churn or not.Only in this case ,instead of a Yes/No question i.e. a binary classsification,
                - we are going to use the multi-class classification approach to accommodated for the seversl classes of faulty products that might be possible here.
        
 Step 4:

Buisness Problem : The Main Challenge the major hospital face is that if X-ray machine go down,they would have to compromise with their service and which lead to loss of revenue and patient for them,
        Our Main task,is to make sure that if an X-ray machine goes down,we're able to get it back up as quikely as possible.
        
Solution Starergey:
 1. Buisness problem indentification and solution
 2. formulate buiness problem to datat science problem
 3. understanding tool which understand data like pre-processing,cleaning,
 4. How to model data to predict issue such complex machine like x-ray
 5. how the modele is good by model evalution.
 
 
 Step 1: Buisness problem identification:
        - here a x-ray machine handler or doctor found issue with it like malfunction or it get heated or beeping sound etc.
        - so when a any x-ray machine failed then hospital called to manufacture or expert support to identify root cause of issue (Online expert support)
        - Then to identify root cause(Trobleshoot tools) it may take 4-8 days with 5000 doller loss/day.
        - when he found issue then he also required exchange part to replace so he order them ,so also required 3-5 days with 400 doller /visit.
        - Then to install it and fixed x-ray machine required 3-5 days required 400 doller/visit
        
        - So time taken to fix the machine :10-18 days.
        - Total revenue lost:50 doller to 100K.

Buisness Problem : The Main Challenge the major hospital face is that if X-ray machine go down,they would have to compromise with their service and which lead to loss of revenue and patient for them,
        Our Main task,is to make sure that if an X-ray machine goes down,we're able to get it back up as quikely as possible.
        
Solution Starergey:
 1. Buisness problem indentification and solution
 2. formulate buiness problem to data science problem
 3. understanding tool which understand data like pre-processing,cleaning,
 4. How to model data to predict issue such complex machine like x-ray
 5. how the modele is good by model evalution.
 
 
 Step 1: Buisness problem identification:
        - here a x-ray machine handler or doctor found issue with it like malfunction or it get heated or beeping sound etc.
        - so when a any x-ray machine failed then hospital called to manufacture or expert support to identify root cause of issue (Online expert support)
        - Then to identify root cause(Trobleshoot tools) it may take 4-8 days with 5000 doller loss/day.
        - when he found issue then he also required exchange part to replace so he order them ,so also required 3-5 days with 400 doller /visit.
        - Then to install it and fixed x-ray machine required 3-5 days required 400 doller/visit
        
        - So time taken to fix the machine :10-18 days.
        - Total revenue lost:50 doller to 100K.
        
 Step 2: convert business problem to data science problem.
        - Here which step do you think will be suitable for optimaizing using machine learning algorithm.
        -- We observed that the 3rd step,the online expert takes around 4-8 days to idnetify the root cause of the problem and recommend certain possible solution .
        -- Here ,the expert looksat the machine logs and the doctor description and along with their technical knowledge give the neccesary recommendation as to which parts might be faulty,
        -- And nned to be replaced .
        -- Machine learning solution would be most suitable for optimise this stepwhere a model can be build on past issue datat to give reccomendations automatically.
        
 Step 3:Identifying model.
        - ``As we know problem where a model would be handling out recommendation on the possibly faulty parts based on the machine data and the doctor's description and therfor help the online export in saving a tremendous amount of time.``
        - As per our data contain categorical data so we categorical approach classification model .
        - In our data contain all history for reason for faulty,how to be tackeld ,and which part may going faulty from all the part of x-ray machine .
        - so we check which part is mostly get faulty so we can comapre current situation.
        - Another soLn: Since you're trying to predict the class of the faulty product on the basis of the machine data and the doctor's description.It would be similar to identifying whether ,
                - a customer will churn or not.Only in this case ,instead of a Yes/No question i.e. a binary classsification,
                - we are going to use the multi-class classification approach to accommodated for the seversl classes of faulty products that might be possible here.
        
PROBLEM MAPPING:
        - Now the problem statement has been defined ,it's time for you to have a discussion with the customer and map entire solution for problem to the data science problem.
        
        - Customer:- The online expret who analyze the data and gives recommendation.
        
        - Expected machine learning Solution:
                - The model analyzes the data and gives 3 recommendation.
                - The model provide additional insights
                
        - Major data sources:
                - Description from a doctor(unstructured data with text)
                - Data generated by the machine (structured with high noise and volume. 
        (means the customer in this case of online expert,who analyze data sent by hosptial and hands out 2-3 recommendation on the faulty parts that need to get replaced,
        Therefore ,the expected ML soltion should be similar recommendations and then also additional insights on why it is giving recommendation)
        
        - Additional Data sources:
        (Once you  collect major data sources,it's always look for additional data sources and use them for model building process)
                - Machine configruation
                - Historical problem data(eg a machine used in india is 12-13 per days where in US is used 3-6/day so like issue also different.like india most of time element in x-ray tube erosion mostly.)
                - Consult from data engineer team.

SOLUTION APPROACH:
        - Building a quick Minimum viable product(MVP) Model:
                - Once you have collected the data,it is usually necessary to build a fast MVP(minimum viable product) that can be easily evaluated and showing to client for their review.
                - This model acts a POC(Proof of concept) for them and help you get the approval and your solution approach.
                - So customer get interested in project might help in funding also and he provides more information also.
                
 DATA COLLECTION :
        - customer relationship management (CRM) database:
                - Captures the interaction between the service organization and the customer.
                - Data includes machine ID,no of services,request raised no,what be fault part,discription about that.
        - Machine logs:
                - Captures states of the machine at each instance
                - Data is high velocity and noise.
        - Sensor data:
                - where x-ray is complex machine including more no of sensors.
                - Which description of pysical enviroment of the machine.
                - Sensor could be based on temprature ,pressure,rotation ,etc.
                - Data is high velocity and noise with continous data.
 
 DATA PRE-PROCESSING TECHINQUES:
        - Use Big-Data technology for high volume and high velocity data.
        - Build Quality Measure report 
                - check a data value that has been not useful ,columns which not useful in further process,the make report for these for data engineer and customer show the report,
        - Transform the unstructure data (using  nLP)
        - Aggegate the stuctured data.
        - Standardizing and merge the data.

EDA:
        -Univariate analysis:
                - Identify columns which have predictive power.
                - Used variance thesholding
        - Detect and handle outlier:
                - e.g... if upgrad recognise by healthcare machines techincines to get part replace this is genune request ? No beacuse it intiate by heathcare department.
        - Bivariate:
                - correlation (remove col highly correlated)
                - recognize predictive power of feature in classification model.
         
MODEL BUILDING:
        - Q) Which ML algorith can be possible used as in MVP in this case:::
                - Since it is classification models,we need to start with linear model like logistic regresison which have very good intrpretability and will help us in building a fast MVP and explain the result to client.
        - used non-linear models(deep learning):
                -so we linear model to explanation and non- linear model for prediction
                - better oerformance than linear models.
                - models are less interpretable.
        -DRM:
                -PCA and SVD
                - customized technique using correlation
        - Feature selection:
                - dicussion with the customer
                - understand feature importance
                - Apply feature enginerring
                - drop certain feature
        - class imbalance:
                - use sampling weighting to handle class imbalance.
                - give low weight to redundant information and high weightage to novel information
MODEL EVALUTION:
        -FIND efficiency of the solution that he created.
